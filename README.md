# **Pizza Place Sales: Product and Time Period Analytics Dashboard**

## **Executive Summary**  
The Pizza Place Sales project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize sales data for a pizza restaurant chain. The dashboard integrates data from customer orders, menu items, and sales trends to provide actionable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and inventory management. This helps the business improve operational efficiency, optimize sales strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## **Business Problem**  
Pizza Place faced challenges in understanding customer preferences, sales trends, and operational performance. The absence of a centralized reporting system made it difficult to track popular menu items, identify underperforming locations, and optimize inventory. This lack of data-driven insights led to inefficiencies in sales strategy and inventory management, impacting profitability.

## **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project was to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that:
- Monitors sales performance by location, menu item, and time period to identify trends and optimize sales strategies.
- Analyzes peak order times and adjusts staffing levels to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.
- Identifies high-performing pizzas and customer segments.
- Provides actionable insights to improve marketing and sales strategies.

## **Tools I Use**  
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **Power Query**: For data transformation, cleaning, and integration from multiple sources.  
- **DAX**: For advanced data analysis, calculations, and KPIs.

## **Suggestions**  
- Introducing bundling deals or "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" promotions could significantly boost the number of pizzas per order. This strategy encourages customers to purchase more pizzas in a single transaction, which can increase overall revenue while providing added value for customers.
- There is a clear need to enhance the variety and appeal of veggie pizzas, as they rank at the bottom in terms of sales from August to December.
- Prioritize the top 10 pizzas that contribute the most to sales.
- Introduce a reward system where customers earn points for each purchase, which they can later redeem for free or discounted pizzas.

## **Challenges**  
A key challenge was ensuring the accuracy and completeness of sales data, especially when integrating information from various sources such as customer orders, inventory systems, and sales records. Cleaning and transforming this data using Power Query required careful handling to prevent errors. Additionally, designing dynamic Power BI reports that provided real-time insights while maintaining dashboard performance was a challenge due to the large volumes of transaction data.

## **Learnings**  
- Gained expertise in using DAX to create complex calculations and KPIs that track key sales metrics.
- Improved skills in Power Query for transforming and cleaning sales data from different sources.
- Learned to design user-friendly dashboards that allow restaurant managers to make data-driven decisions.
- Gained insights into the restaurant industry and how data can optimize sales, inventory, and marketing strategies.
- Enhanced knowledge of optimizing Power BI dashboards to handle large datasets and ensure high performance.
